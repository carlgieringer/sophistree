# TODO

- Async manager may no longer be necessary if script is at end...

- Test with more examples

- Include conclusion outcomes in map card (and include aggregate of all outcomes ("50% false"))
- Add 'sources excerpted for evidence' in map card

- Try adding

  "plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked",
  "plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked",

- Justification appearances
- Collapsing

- Discover maps/appearances on current page
- Feed of maps/critiques/updates
  - What is a critique vs. an update?
  - User must affirmatively respond to all/most leaf nodes from map to be a 'critique'?
- Non-extension experience:

  - Page rewriter adding highlights?

- Following: limit current page/feed to just those followd

- Searching content by URL and proposition

- Sharing a map
- Critiquing a map (voting, adding new justifications, how to calculate outcomes?)
- Mobile experience
- Aggregating maps
- Surfacing aggregated info in a map when editing and critiquing.
- Coauthoring maps (group permissions)

- Non-neutral outcome navigation on content page (go to next green/red thing)
- Appearance justifications
- undo/redo

- Filter entity list for disconnected nodes?
  - (Filter by all nodes and disconnected?)
  - Propositions, MediaExcerpts
- Equivalent propositions:
  - combine appearances
  - combine justifications
- Support setting Justification polarity via drag.
